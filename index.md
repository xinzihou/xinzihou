# Xinzi Hou 丨 侯鑫子
- My name is Xinzi Hou (侯鑫子), pronounced as [xou<sup>35</sup> ɕin<sup>55</sup> tsɿ<sup>214</sup>].

- I’m an current PhD student in Linguistics at [LLS, Uni of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/language/). 

- My research interests include: acoustic phonetics, tone and intonation of tonal languages, Chinese dialects, accented Mandarin (dialect-Mandarin interlanguage), phonetics-phonology interface, traditional Chinese linguistics. 

- My PhD project focuses on the pitch systems of Nanning Mandarin, an accented Mandarin in Southeastern China. I study its tonal and intonational representation, how the two systems interact, and how their interaction fits in the broader field of theories about Chinese tone-intonation relationship. 
I completed MA in Linguistics at University College London in 2019 and BA in Chinese Language and Literature at Beijing Normal University in 2018.
